# TEJ-Projects

These are some of the projects I created for my highschool TEJ course.

## Firefighter Robot:
 - This project I created a robot that traverses a maze to extinguish a flame.
 - Utilized 2 distance sensors, 1 line detector and 1 infrared sensor to steer and use a blower fan effectively.
 - This was the only bot in the class to successfully extinguish a flame.

## 5x5x5 LED Cube:
 - This project I created a 5x5x5 LED cube. I designed the pcb and solder the circuit board and cube together.
 - Using Basic I created an animation cycle that uses PWM to show complex designs.
